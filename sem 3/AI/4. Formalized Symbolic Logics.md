### 4.2 Syntax and Semantics for Propositional Logic

**Propositional Logic (PL)** is a special case of FOPL.

**Syntax** The syntax of PL determines valid statements or sentences (also called formulas or well-formed formulas) by governing the combination of basic building blocks: propositions and logical connectives.

- **Propositions** are elementary atomic sentences that must be either true or false.
- **Compound propositions** are formed using propositions and logical connectives.
- **Symbols for Logical Connectives** include:
    - **`-`** for not or negation.
    - **`&`** for and or conjunction.
    - **`V`** for or or disjunction.
    - **`->`** for if...then or implication.
    - **`<->`** for if and only if or double implication.
- When omitting parentheses, the connectives follow a precedence hierarchy from highest to lowest: `-`, `&`, `V`, `->`, and `<->`.

**Semantics** The semantics (or meaning) of a sentence is the assignment of a truth value (true or false) to it. The truth value of a statement is determined by applying semantic rules repeatedly to its component parts until a single truth value is established based on a given interpretation.

**Properties of Statements**

- A statement is **satisfiable** if there is at least one interpretation for which it is true.
- A sentence is a **contradiction** (or unsatisfiable) if no interpretation exists for which it is true.
- A sentence $s$ is a **logical consequence** of a set of sentences ${s_1, \dots, s_n}$ if, for every interpretation where all $s_i$ are true, $s$ is also true.
- This concept of logical consequence is crucial, as it provides a means to perform **valid inferencing** in PL.

### 4.3 Syntax and Semantics for FOPL (First-Order Predicate Logic)

FOPL (also called Predicate Calculus) is one of the most important methods in AI for knowledge representation because it offers a sound theoretical foundation and is flexible enough to accurately represent natural language reasonably well. FOPL extends the expressiveness of PL, allowing for the description of properties of objects, relations among entities, and generalized statements about classes of similar objects.

**Syntax of FOPL** The generalization of PL in FOPL comes from the introduction of predicates, functions, variables, and quantifiers.

- **Connectives:** FOPL uses the same five logical connectives as PL: `-`, `&`, `V`, `->`, and `<->`.
- **Quantifiers:**
    - **$\exists$** (existential quantification), meaning "for some $x$" or "there is an $x$".
    - **$\forall$** (universal quantification), meaning "for all $x$".
- **Predicates:** Symbols denoting relations or functional mappings from elements of a domain to the values true or false. They may have $n$ arguments (where $n \geq 0$). A 0-ary predicate is a proposition.
- **Terms:** Constants, variables, and functions are referred to as terms.
- **Atomic Formulas (Atoms):** Predicates are referred to as atomic formulas.
- **Literal:** An atom or its negation.
- **Well-Formed Formulas (Wffs):** Defined recursively, wffs are formed from atomic formulas and the proper application of quantifiers and logical connectives. Quantification is applied only to variables (not predicates) in FOPL.

**Semantics for FOPL** FOPL semantics are defined over a specific **domain $D$** (the set of all objects being reasoned about). An **interpretation** is given to a wff when fixed assignments are made to all constants, variables, functions, and predicate symbols within that wff. Under an interpretation, literals evaluate to true or false, allowing the overall value of any wff to be determined using truth values for subexpressions, similar to PL.

### 4.4 Properties of Wffs

Wffs in FOPL share properties similar to PL statements:

- A wff is **valid** if it is true under every interpretation.
- A wff is **inconsistent** (or unsatisfiable) if it is false under every interpretation.
- A wff is **invalid** if it is false for at least one interpretation.
- A wff is **satisfiable** if it is true for at least one interpretation.
- A wff $Q$ is a **logical consequence** of a set of wffs $P_1, \dots, P_n$ if $Q$ is true whenever the conjunction $P_1 \wedge P_2 \wedge \dots \wedge P_n$ is true under an interpretation.

**Normal Forms** Any wff can be transformed into one of two normal forms:

- **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):** A conjunction of formulas, where each formula consists only of the disjunction of literals (e.g., $( \neg P \vee Q \vee R) \wedge (\neg P \vee Q) \wedge R$).
- **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF):** A disjunction of formulas, where each formula consists only of the conjunction of literals (e.g., $(P \wedge Q \wedge R) \vee (Q \wedge R) \vee P$).

### 4.5 Conversion to Clausal Form

Conversion to clausal form is necessary for mechanical inference methods like **resolution**.

**Definitions**

- A **clause** is the disjunction of a number of literals.
- A **ground clause** is one that contains no variables.
- A **Horn clause** is a clause with at most one positive literal.

**Clausal Conversion Procedure** To transform any FOPL sentence into clausal form, a series of steps is required:

1. **Eliminate Connectives:** Remove all implication (`->`) and equivalency (`<->`) symbols.
2. **Move Negation Inward:** Move negation symbols to apply only to individual atoms.
3. **Rename Variables:** Ensure all remaining quantifiers bind different variables.
4. **Skolemize:** Replace all existentially quantified variables with **Skolem functions**, and then delete the corresponding existential quantifiers. Skolem functions may take universally quantified variables (to the left of the existential quantifier in the expression) as arguments if the existential variable is dependent on them.
5. **CNF and Quantifier Placement:** Move all universal quantifiers to the left and convert the remaining expression into CNF.
6. **Final Cleanup:** Eliminate all universal quantifiers and conjunctions (as they are retained implicitly). The resulting expressions are the final clauses.

It is important to note that the set of clauses produced by this conversion process **retains satisfiability**; that is, the clauses are satisfiable if and only if the original sentence is satisfiable, but the final clauses are not necessarily logically equivalent to the original expression.

### 4.6 Inference Rules

Inference rules provide the means to perform logical proofs or deductions. In FOPL, analogous to PL, the core inference rule is **Modus Ponens**.

- **Modus Ponens:** If assertion $P(a)$ and implication $\forall x P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)$ are true, one can conclude $Q(a)$.
- **Substitution:** Necessary in FOPL to replace variables (like $x$) with constants (like $a$) when applying universal implications.
- **Complementary Literals:** Two literals are complementary if they are identical but have opposite signs (e.g., $P$ and $\neg P$).
- **Unification:** A critical part of inference, unification is the process of finding a set of substitutions—specifically the **most general unifier (mgu)**—that makes two literals identical.
- **Factor:** A clause derived when unification makes two or more literals within a single clause identical. The factor is the remaining clause after deleting all but one of the unified literals.
