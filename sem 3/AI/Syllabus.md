## I. Russell and Norvig: Artificial Intelligence – A Modern Approach

This structure covers the selected topics from Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

### Chapter 1: Introduction (Sections 1.1, 1.4)
- **1.1 What Is AI?**
    - (Subtopics implicitly covered within the discussion of AI definitions and approaches):
        - Acting humanly: The Turing test approach
        - Natural language processing, Knowledge representation, Automated reasoning, Machine learning (required for the Turing test)
        - Total Turing test (requires Computer vision and Robotics)
        - Acting rationally: The rational agent approach
        - The standard model
- **1.4 The State of the Art**

### Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents (Complete)

- **2.1 Agents and Environments**
- **2.2 Good Behavior: The Concept of Rationality**
- **2.3 The Nature of Environments**
    - (Subtopics defining environment properties):
        - Fully observable vs. partially observable
        - Single-agent vs. multiagent
        - Deterministic vs. stochastic
        - Episodic vs. sequential
        - Static vs. dynamic (and semidynamic)
        - Discrete vs. continuous
        - Known vs. unknown
