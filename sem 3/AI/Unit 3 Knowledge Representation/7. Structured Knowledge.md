## 7.1 Introduction

- Previous chapters focused on knowledge representation using formalized symbolic logics (PL and FOPL), addressing issues of expressiveness, validity, and consistency.
- The representation of simple facts using methods like clausal form often involves repeating an object's name for each association, resulting in entries that lack particular order or grouping.
- While simple representations suffice for small Knowledge Bases (KBs), large, complex bodies of information require **knowledge structuring** and **organization** (for efficient storage and recall).
- Real-world problem domains typically involve many interacting objects that require extensive characterizations and complex relational descriptions.

## 7.2 Associative Networks (Semantic Networks)

Associative networks (also known as semantic networks) provide a means of structuring knowledge by clustering related pieces into coherent semantic groups.

### Structure and Components

- **Definition:** They are **directed graphs with labeled nodes and arcs or arrows**.
- **Representation:** Networks offer a pictorial presentation of objects, their attributes, and relationships.
- **Nodes:** Commonly represent **objects or nouns**, concepts, attributes, or basic entities.
- **Arcs/Links:** Represent **relations**. The direction of an arc usually follows the order of arguments in a relational statement.
- **Origin:** Associative networks were introduced by Quillian (1968) to model word and sentence semantics.
- **Common Links:** Many common arc relations are used, including **ISA** (is a), **MEMBER-OF**, **SUBSET-OF**, **AKO** (a-kind-of), **HAS-PARTS**, **INSTANCE-OF**, **AGENT**, and **ATTRIBUTES**.
    - The **ISA link** has a special meaning, signifying that an object is of a certain type (predication) or that one type is a subtype of another (conditional quantification).

### Utility and Inference

- **Knowledge Clustering:** Networks clearly show an entity's attributes and relationships, making retrieval of associated properties easy.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** They can exhibit hierarchical or taxonomic structures (e.g., showing how a university system is composed of colleges and departments).
- **Property Inheritance:** Associative network structures permit **property inheritance**, a form of inference where nodes (members or subsets) may inherit properties from higher-level ancestor nodes. This inheritance is a form of **default reasoning**, assuming characteristics are inherited unless contradicted.
- **Storage Efficiency:** Information storage is made efficient because shared properties are only stored once at the highest node to which they apply.
- **Implementation:** They can be implemented in languages like LISP using property lists, linking all of an object's properties to a single atom.
- **Formalism:** The semantics of associative networks can be defined along the lines of traditional logics, often relying on **node and arc matching processes** for inference.

## 7.3 Frame Structures

Frames are a structured knowledge representation scheme introduced by Marvin Minsky (1975).

### Structure and Components

- **Purpose:** Frames are data structures intended to represent a **mental model of a stereotypical situation** or concept (e.g., eating in a restaurant).
- **Composition:** They are general record-like structures consisting of a collection of **slots** and **slot values**.
- **Facets:** Slots may contain subfields called **facets**, which allow for flexibility in organizing the knowledge.
- **Slot Information:** Slots typically contain:
    - Attribute-value pairs.
    - Default values.
    - Conditions for filling the slot.
    - Pointers to other related frames.
    - Procedures that activate automatically.
- **Procedural Attachments (Demons):** These are procedures attached to slots. They include:
    - **if-needed:** Procedures triggered when a slot value is required but not explicitly provided (e.g., calculating a vehicle's range).
    - **if-added** and **if-removed:** Procedures triggered when a value is added or deleted from a slot, potentially updating dependent frames.
- **Frame Hierarchies:** Frames are commonly **linked together in a network** (often using AKO pointers), enabling the easy implementation of property inheritance and default reasoning.

## 7.4 Conceptual Dependencies and Scripts

### Conceptual Dependencies (CDs)

- **Origin:** CD theory provides the primitive building blocks used in Scripts and other structures, based on Roger Schank’s work.
- **Primitives:** Uses a **limited number of primitive concepts and rules of formation** to represent natural language statements.
- **Goal:** To achieve a **unique CD representation** for sentences with the same meaning, regardless of syntactic ambiguity.
- **Ontological Building Blocks:** CD distinguishes five types of building blocks: Entities (Picture Producers/Aiders), Actions (Primitive Actions or ACTs), Conceptual Cases (Objective, Directive, Instrumental, Recipient), Conceptual Dependencies (Semantic rules linking elements), and Conceptual Tenses (time of action or state).
- **Syntax:** Uses graphic structures to represent sentence meanings, adhering to basic syntax rules (e.g., ACT --O--> PP implies a primitive action has an object).
- **Semantics Focus:** CD theory is primarily concerned with the **semantics of events**.

### Scripts

- **Definition:** Scripts are specialized, frame-like structures used to represent **stereotypical patterns for commonly occurring events** (e.g., going to the movies, shopping).
- **Purpose in NL:** Scripts were originally developed to help programs **"understand" natural language text or stories** by providing an expected scenario for a given situation.
- **Structure:** Like a play, a script defines **actors, roles, props, and scenes**. Slots in the script are filled with CD primitives describing the events.
- **Reasoning:** Scripts contain knowledge necessary for common everyday activities, allowing systems to provide an **expected scenario** and fill in missing details when interpreting language.

## Summary of Structures (Chapter 7)

This chapter covered associative networks, which link concepts and relations in graphical structures, and frame structures, which serve as general units of knowledge, utilizing slots, facets, procedural attachments, and inheritance. Finally, scripts were detailed as special frame-like structures for modeling stereotypical event sequences, built upon Conceptual Dependency theory.
